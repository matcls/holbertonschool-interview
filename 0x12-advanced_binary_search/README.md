# 0x12. Advanced Binary Search

![binary_search](https://i.imgur.com/pOLXBw0.jpg)

## Description

You may have noticed that basic binary search does not necessarily return the index of the first value in the array (if this value appears more than once in the array). 

Add function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers.

 **Prototype:**
```C
    int advanced_binary(int *array, size_t size, int value);
```
* array: is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
* size:  is the number of elements in array
* value: is the value to search for

* Return the index where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
* Every time you split the array, you have to print the new array (or subarray) youâ€™re searching in (See example)
* You have to use recursion. You may only use one loop (while, for, do while, etc.) in order to print the array

## Usage
#### In a terminal or emulator:
```bash
# First compile the source code:
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-advanced_binary.c -o 0-advanced_binary
# Run the program
$./0-advanced_binary
Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
Searching in array: 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
Searching in array: 8, 9
Found 8 at index: 8

Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 5, 5
Searching in array: 5, 5
Found 5 at index: 3

Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
Searching in array: 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
Searching in array: 8, 9
Searching in array: 9
Found 999 at index: -1
```
### Main file
```bash
$ cat 0-main.c
```
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
		int array[] = {
				0, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
		};
		size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

		printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 8, advanced_binary(array, size, 8));
		printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 5, advanced_binary(array, size, 5));
		printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, advanced_binary(array, size, 999));
		return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```
